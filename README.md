It improves time management and increase confident levels and focus.
Students often struggle with managing their study schedules effectively due to multiple subjects, varying priorities, approaching deadlines, and personal productivity patterns. Traditional study timetables are rigid and fail to adapt to changes such as unexpected tasks, missed study sessions, or shifting priorities. This often leads to stress, poor time management, and reduced academic performance.

There is a need for a Smart Study Planner that can dynamically generate and update personalized study plans. The planner should:
Allow users to input their subjects, topics, deadlines, and available study hours.
Prioritize tasks based on urgency, importance, and difficulty level.
Adapt the schedule automatically when changes occur (e.g., a session is skipped).
Provide reminders, progress tracking, and performance insights.
Encourage better time management by balancing study with breaks and leisure activities.
